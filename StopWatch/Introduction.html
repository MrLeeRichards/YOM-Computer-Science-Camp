        <h1>Psalm 90:12-17</h1>
        <ol start="12">
            <li>So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom.</li>
            <li>Return, O Lord, how long? and let it repent thee concerning thy servants.</li>
            <li>O satisfy us early with thy mercy; that we may rejoice and be glad all our days.</li>
            <li>Make us glad according to the days wherein thou hast afflicted us, and the years wherein we have seen evil.</li>
            <li>Let thy work appear unto thy servants, and thy glory unto their children.</li>
            <li>And let the beauty of the Lord our God be upon us: and establish thou the work of our hands upon us; yea, the work of our hands establish thou it.</li>
